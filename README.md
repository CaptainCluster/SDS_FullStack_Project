This repository contains the following:
* The Project
* Learning diary 
* Links to seeing the project run & a video demonstration

The four exercise modules and their GitHub repository can be by clicking [this link](https://github.com/CaptainCluster/SoftwareDevSkills_FullStack_Modules)

As for the mandatory (in terms of course evaluation) **video**, it can be found by clicking [this link](https://youtu.be/b_UM34K0NPs?si=KZb30_LFWpOyI4mI)

❓ How to start the application?
---
First you have to create a *.env* file that contains a string in a variable called *MONGODB*. This string is used to establish a connection to a MongoDB cluster. A cluster can be established for free
on the MongoDB official website.

The repository comes with the *Angular-Cli* front-end already built. All you need to do is run the
following commands on your terminal:

> Installing the dependencies:`npm install`

> Running the application: `npm run dev`

Now the application should run on port 3000.

❓Issues with Angular build?
---
In case you run into issues, you can run the following commands to build the *Angular-Cli* again.
Run the following commands, if you wish to do so.

> Changing the directory to the Angular front-end side: `cd angular-src`

> Installing dependencies of Angular: `npm install`

> Building the Angular Application:
